		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>We care about your privacy</p>
		<p>This is a research related demo and not a commercial activity. We collect only minimal anonymous data
			directly from the users. We collect no identifiable natural person data. All the personal data we store is
			represented by users' answers to the quiz: reported country, reported age, reported
			group affiliation, the assessment of the statements in the quiz and the time when the quiz was
			submitted. We do not verify this information, we do not record any identifiable data and we do not use any
			third party services on this website that could infer such information. The above mentioned data is freely
			submitted by the user and cannot be removed on request as it cannot be identified to an individual.</p>
		<p>To ensure the security (uptime) of this website, we temporarily store server logs that contain users' IP and
			request user agent for a limited period of time. We do not (and most often cannot) correlate the quiz
			responses with these logs. These logs are removed in a period of three weeks or less. This is the legitimate
			interest for the security of the website. On request, we can remove any temporary log containing a specific
			IP and user agent pair.</p>
